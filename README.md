**Modular Tkinter To-Do Application** 📝 ✅  
A clean, structured, and modular **To-Do List Application** built with **Python and Tkinter**. This project follows a **modular architecture**, making it **easy to maintain, extend, and customize**.  

🌟 **Features**  
✔ **Task Management** – Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete.  
✔ **Persistent Storage** – Tasks are saved in a JSON file to retain data across sessions.  
✔ **Priority-Based Sorting** – Organizes tasks by priority and completion status.  
✔ **Custom Theming** – The UI is styled using a dedicated theme manager for a polished look.  
✔ **Modular Architecture** – Code is structured into separate modules for better maintainability.  
✔ **Error Handling & Validations** – Includes message prompts and checks for smooth functionality.  

🏗 **Project Structure**  
📂 **`main.py`** – Entry point that initializes and runs the application.  
📂 **`todo_app.py`** – Manages the overall application structure and UI integration.  
📂 **`theme_manager.py`** – Defines colors, fonts, and styles for a consistent UI experience.  
📂 **`task_manager.py`** – Handles all data operations (adding, editing, storing tasks).  
📂 **`ui_components.py`** – Contains reusable UI components like sidebar, task input, and task list.  

🚀 **Why Use This Structure?**  
✅ **Separation of Concerns** – Each module has a well-defined responsibility.  
✅ **Maintainability** – Clean code structure makes debugging and improvements easier.  
✅ **Reusability** – UI components can be reused in other projects.  
✅ **Scalability** – Easily extend the app with new features without modifying the entire codebase.
